		<p>Ford’s Mustang Mach 1 Premium oozes speed, power, grunt and boogity all in a hot fastback design wrapped in a Jet Gray paint scheme with non-glare black hood and side stripes trimmed gloriously in orange.</p>
		<p>There’s no way you see this car and don’t immediately think of speed. Of course, that’s what Ford wants. It’s the reason Mustang is the only remaining car in its lineup.</p>
		<p>Speed sells, and even if we can’t hit its top speed of 168 mph on the highway, buyers want to know they could. Or they want you to know they might.</p>
		<p>For my money the looks alone could persuade me to consider a Mustang, but shoehorn in a throbbing 5.0-liter V8 that sounds like it’s ready for Daytona and the Mach 1, which is available in limited quantities for 2021, is a no-brainer.</p>
		<p>If you fancy yourself a star-spangled racer wannabe, one that wants to put American metal on the pole or put a whooping on other makes, the Mach 1is calling your name.</p>
		<p>That V8 pumps out an impressive 480 horses, 20 more than an already muscle-bound Mustang GT and packs parts engineered by Shelby American for its GT350 and GT500 models.</p>
		<p>This racier Mach 1, a throwback name, takes the place of previous Bullitt and GT350 Mustangs and the GT with Ford’s Performance Pack 2.</p>
        <p>At $52,915 it’s a relative bargain for a track-ready racer, and a darn sight easier on the wallet than a full-on serious racer like the GT500 that lists at $71,495.</p>
